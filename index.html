        <p>This is a blog about how I figured out how to solve the Rubik's Cube.</p>
    </section>

        <p>I first attempted to solve the Rubik’s cube half a year ago when I had my study-abroad semester at Duke and during the orientation week, I obtained a free Rubik’s cube with the DKU logo on the top side. 
            I fiddled with the cube for several weeks, until bringing it with me unsolved to a museum with my roommate’s church one day, where a member of the church quickly solved it for me. 
            I was a bit hesitant to mess with the cube after that, knowing that I couldn’t put it back in place. 
            I later obtained a sticker of the Duke Blue Devil mascot and decided to stick it onto my Rubik’s cube opposite the DKU logo. 
            Unfortunately, even after cutting the grid through the sticker, the Rubik’s cube was much harder to move after that. 
            In addition, the task of solving it would have gotten much more difficult as each piece would need to be in the correct orientation in addition to the correct placement. 
            I stopped attempting to solve the Rubik’s cube until very recently when I obtained a new cube.</p>
        <p> I have with me a Rubik's cube with white on top, blue, orange, green, and red going clockwise around the sides, and yellow on the bottom that I bought five days ago from a local stationary store, here in Kunshan, Jiangsu, China when out with my friends.</p>

        <p> From the beginning, I had endeavored to solve the Rubik's cube on my own without help from the Internet, and set to work figuring it out as I found the messing around with the cube and discovering patterns previously unknown much more fun than reading how to solve it online and simply following the steps and being frustrated when it doesn’t work despite doing exactly as the instructions say.</p>

        <p> Let me label how I will refer to the operations and pieces of the cube. I will refer to each small cube of the Rubik’s cube as a ‘piece’, each piece that has only one color as a central piece, each piece that has two colors as a side piece, and each piece that has three colors as a corner piece. I will refer to the placement of piece regardless of what colors face which direction as its ‘position’ and I will refer to the state of the piece’s colors facing a certain direction as its ‘orientation’.</p>

        <p>When attempting to solve the cube I had back at Duke, I pretty quickly figured out how to get the first layer into place. This I could still remember to do. Soon, I found a trick to put the second layer in place, as well as the side pieces on the bottom layer. This left the corners of the third layer. I experimented with operations that would keep the top layer in place while changing the corners of the top layer until I came across a method that would allow me to fix the corners as I like. From there, solving the cube was simpler as I just had to do the second operation I found to place the side pieces into place.</p>
