        <h1>How To Solve a Rubik's Cube</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>This is a blog about how I figured out how to solve the Rubik's Cube.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>I first attempted to solve the Rubik’s cube half a year ago when I had my study-abroad semester at Duke. During orientation week, I obtained a free Rubik’s cube with the DKU logo on the top side. I fiddled with the cube for several weeks, until bringing it with me to a museum with my roommate’s church one day, where a member of the church quickly solved it for me. I was a bit hesitant to mess with the cube after that, knowing that I couldn’t put it back in place. I later stuck a Blue Devil sticker onto the cube which made it more difficult to move and further deterred me from playing with the cube any longer. I stopped attempting to solve the Rubik’s cube until this past week.</p>
        <p>Five days ago, I bought a Rubik’s cube from a local stationary store here in Kunshan, Jiangsu, China. Since then, I have been playing with it every day and gradually figured out a method to solve it. </p>
        <p>From the beginning, I had endeavored to solve the Rubik's cube on my own without help from the Internet as I found messing around with the cube and discovering patterns previously unknown much more fun than reading how to solve it online and simply following the steps. In addition, figuring it out myself would give me a better intuition of how the cube works.</p>
        <p>Let me label how I will refer to the operations and pieces of the cube. I will refer to each small cube in the Rubik’s cube as a ‘piece’, each piece that has only one color as a ‘central piece’, each piece that has two colors as a ‘side piece’, and each piece that has three colors as a ‘corner piece’. I will refer to the placement of the piece with respect to the other pieces regardless of what colors face which direction as its ‘position’ and I will refer to the in place rotation of the piece, causing its colors to face a certain direction as its ‘orientation’. I consider a piece ‘fixed’ if neither its position or orientation is changed by an operation. I also consider a ‘rotation in place’ to mean a piece’s change only in orientation, but not in position.</p>
        <p>My current Rubik’s cube is white on top, blue, orange, green, and red going clockwise around the sides, and yellow on the bottom, and thus I will sometimes refer to the top as the white face, or the bottom as the yellow face. </p>
        <p>I will typically consider the cube as viewed with the white on top and yellow on the bottom. Therefore, the top or first layer is the layer with the white face, the bottom or third layer is the layer with the yellow face, and the middle or second layer is the layer with no white or yellow.</p>
        <p>In addition, I consider a ‘rotation’ or a ‘shift’ to be a 90 degree rotation in the mentioned direction. For example, shifting or rotating a specific row or column down once would mean to rotate it down 90 degrees.</p>
        <p>When initially attempting to solve the cube back at Duke, I pretty quickly figured out how to get the first layer into place. This I could still remember how to do. Over the past week, I found a method to put the second layer in place, as well as the side pieces on the bottom layer. This left the corners of the third layer. I experimented with operations that would keep the top layer in place while changing the corners of the bottom layer until I came across two methods that would allow me to manipulate the corners as I like. From there, solving the cube was simpler as I just had to do the side operation I found to place the side pieces into place.</p>

        <h3>The Top Layer</h3>
        <h4>Top Cross</h4>
        <p>We center our focus around the central white piece, search the rest of the cube for the side white pieces and place them into their correct locations with respect to the four colors on the sides. This gives us a cross on top, which my friend with vague memory of how to solve the cube confirmed was the correct first step.</p>
   
        <h4>Top Complete</h4>
        <p>Next, we want to place the corners into place. Although this was still relatively intuitive early on, I later found a more systematic way to do this while trying to figure out how to fix the bottom corners into place. If we can place the correct corner into its place regardless of its orientation, then we can perform a few easy operations to get it back into place.</p>

        <h3>The Middle Layer</h3>
        <p>Once we have solved the top face, the next obvious step is to solve the middle layer. To do this, I needed to find an operation that allows me to keep the top face fixed while changing the rest of the cube.</p>
        <p>To have a better understanding of how complete my cube is, I typically begin with the central pieces of the middle layer aligned to the corresponding colors on the sides of the top layer.</p>
   
        <h4>Side Operation</h4>
        <p>This operation allows us to take the bottom center side of the bottom face and place it onto the left or right side of our current front face. Whatever color is visible for that piece on the bottom face will become the color that is visible on the front face.</p>
        <p>This operation is based on the logic that if we get our cube in a state where the white pieces are solely on the top and bottom rows (eight together on the white face, and one isolated corner piece on the bottom), this would let us rotate the middle row however we wish, hopefully making meaningful changes, while still making the way to put the white face back together very easy.  </p>
        <p>We reach this state by doing the following: Shift the left column of the top face down 90 degrees, rotate the lowest row with the displaced white column to the right 90 degrees, and then shift the displaced white column back up to its original location. Our cube is now in the state mentioned above. </p>
        <p>For simplicity and to make the effects of this operation easy to understand, we only rotate the middle row once to the right, and then perform the reverse of the above shifts to put the white face back together. Finally we can rotate the middle layer once to align the central pieces with the corresponding color of the top layer. This ends up with our cube in a state where the bottom layer’s bottom side piece is now on the left of our front face. In addition, the color that was originally on the bottom before the operation (for example yellow) would now be on the front. The side piece that was originally on our front face to the left will have shifted 90 degrees left to be on our left face to the left. And the side piece originally on our left face to the left is now on our bottom face on the bottom. </p>
        <p>In this way, this operation rotates these three pieces between these three locations, keeping the rest of the cube constant, making minute changes in side pieces relatively easy.</p>
        <p>This operation can also be done on the right side instead of the left side, with the advantage that the color that was shown on the bottom can be placed on the front to the right instead.</p>
        <p>This operation can also be done in reverse to directly put the front side piece onto the bottom, although I personally have difficulty remembering the differences between the reverse operation and the original operation at times and so tend to stick to the original operation when possible.</p>
        <p>Using this side operation, we can put all the side pieces into their proper places. However, we are still unable to move the bottom corner pieces in any way using this operation, leading to the need of corner operations to fully solve the bottom face.</p>

        <h3>The Bottom Layer</h3>
        <p>To solve the corners of the bottom face of the Rubik’s cube, I needed corner operations that would allow me to keep the top layer fixed and change the bottom corners. I sought to find these operations by movinga corner piece of the top layer down and away in a variety of ways until it returns to its original place. </p>
        <p>When shifting the top left column and top bottom row alternatively, I notice that there will always be two positions in which I could keep the displaced corner out of the way of the rotating face and two positions in which the displaced corner would be carried with the rotating face. To find my first corner operation, I experimented with keeping the displaced corner out of the way of the rotations. After finding that my first corner operation keeps the corners in their same position and only rotates them, I attempted to let the displaced corner be affected by the rotating face, which led me to the discovery of my second corner operation. This second operation returns the correct state of the white top face faster and also lets me change the positions of the bottom corners.</p>

        <h4>Corner Operation 1</h4>
        <p>The first corner operation I found changes the orientation of the bottom layer corners in a predictable manner, keeping the position of the corners fixed. This is done by repeatedly shifting a specific corner down and away and then back so that it returns to its place several times in the incorrect orientation, until it finally comes back in the correct orientation.</p>
        <p>This operation is done by choosing a color as our front side and then performing the following operations, rocking back and forth until the top side ends up back in place.</p>
        <p>This operation is done through the following operations:</p>
        <p>Shift the left column of the white side down 90 degrees. Rotate the bottom row of that displaced white column to the right, so that the singular white corner piece is isolated. Rotate the displaced white column back up to its original position.</p>
        <p>Rotate the isolated white corner piece twice to the left with bottom rotations, so that it is out of the way of our next rotation and will not be affected.</p>
        <p>Rotate the front row of the white side (with the missing corner) to the left. Rotate the displaced corner back one to the right so that it is in line with the rotated white row. Rotate the whole row back up to the right so that it is back in its original position, with the manipulated corner now in the correct position but incorrect orientation.</p>
        <p>Repeat this motion until the white corner returns to the correct orientation.</p>
        <p>Once the white face is again in the correct position and orientation, we observe that the top left corner of the bottom yellow face remains in its original position and orientation. The other three corners of the bottom face will have changed orientation but not position. Notably, we also find that the in place rotation of the other three corners happens in a predictable fashion. For example, if a specific corner piece has the colors yellow, blue, and red, then doing this operation consecutively would cause the color on the bottom face to go through the sequence: yellow, red, blue, yellow, red, blue, etc. The side pieces will also have changed, but that is not our present concern.</p>
        <p>Performing this operation a second time will again keep the top left corner of the bottom face fixed while changing again the orientation of the other three corner pieces. Thus, if we had begun with all four corners as yellow facing down, the current state after two iterations of this operation would be yellow in the top right corner with the other three corners as different colors.</p>
        <p>Performing this operation a third time will keep the top right corner of the bottom fixed again, while rotating the other three corners in place one more time, which (this being the third iteration) would return all four corners to a state of yellow on the bottom.</p>
        <p>When solving the cube, this operation is useful when we have all four bottom corners in the correct placement, however with incorrect orientations. Because this operation rotates three corners in place while keeping one chosen corner fixed, to get all four corners to be yellow, we will first want to reach a state where only one corner is yellow. And to get to this state, we would want to reach a state where none of the corners are yellow, so that we can perform this operation and hopefully end up with only one corner in its correct orientation.</p>
        <p>Although very helpful, this operation still does not allow us to change the positions of the corners, leaving us stuck in a state where the corners can be rotated in place, but not moved around. This led me to the need of another corner operation.</p>

        <h4>Corner Operation 2</h4>
        <p>While trying other possibilities for corner operations, I happened to stumble upon this method which returns the top layer’s state faster and will also swap the position of two bottom corners.</p>
        <p>This operation consists of the following operations:</p>
        <p>Rotate down the left column of the top white face. Rotate the bottom row of the displaced white column to the left (so that it is affected when the white column moves back up). Then rotate the displaced white column back up into place. This should result in our displaced corner on the front face directly below our column of interest. Then rotate the displaced corner to left to where it was before we shifted the column back up. Rotate the bottom row of our top white face to the left, and then shift our displaced corner to the right so that it is back in place with the white displaced row. Finally shift the displaced row back to the right so that it again completes the top white face.</p>
        <p>This operation keeps the bottom left corner of the bottom face fixed. The bottom right corner of the bottom face rotates in place, and the top two corners of the bottom face swap places and also rotate.</p>
        <p>This operation is good for when our corners are in the wrong placement, as we will be able to predictably swap the positions of the bottom corners while keeping two in place. In addition, considering that every two iterations of the operation puts the corners back in their original positions, this operation can also be used like Corner Operation 1 to rotate the bottom corners while keeping them in place</p>
        <p>A combination of these two corner methods allows us to put the corners into whatever placement we want, easily allowing us to put all four corners into their correct placement and orientation.</p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>In conclusion, I found that the Rubik’s cube can be solved in three steps.</p>
        <p>First, complete the top white face by creating a white cross and then using corner operations 1 and 2 to put the white corners into place.</p>
        <p>Second, fix the bottom corners in their correct locations by utilizing corner operation 2 to put the corners in their correct placement and then corner operation 1 to put them in their correct orientation (all yellow facing down).</p>
        <p>Finally, use the side operation to put all the sides in their correct respective locations. This step can be a little tricky but can still be accomplished with relative ease.</p>

        <h3>Future Steps</h3>
        <p>Although I have found a reliable method to solve the Rubik’s cube, I admit that this may not be the most efficient way to solve it. I notice that it is sometimes with difficulty that I solve the final step as my side operation affects three pieces at once, which often makes things tricky when only two final pieces are out of place.</p>
        <p>I notice that my corner operations do interesting things to the side pieces that I have not looked too deeply into and note that corner operation 2 if performed numerous times, will reach a state with all the corner pieces back in their original positions and orientations with side pieces in a different state, and then after performing corner operation 2 again that number of times, will result in all four corners back in their positions and orientations, with side pieces in their original state. Hypothetically, if I knew what that altered state looked like, then upon finding that in my cube, rather than performing side operations to complete the cube, I could perform corner operation 2 to complete it faster. In addition, there are numerous other possible corner operations that I did not explore which may hold possibilities for quicker solving. </p>
